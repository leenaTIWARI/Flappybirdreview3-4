High Score Tracking: Save and display the highest score achieved.
Background Animation: Enjoy a continuously scrolling background to enhance the visual experience.
Sound Effects: Includes sound effects for flapping, collisions, and background music.
Technologies Used
Java: Programming language for game development.
